The Internet has vastly become one of the most prominent ways of communicating amongst one another within the last couple of decades. By utilizing tools such as VOIP, social media, emailing, instant messenger, etc., humans from all over the world have been able to share information within seconds with a mere stroke of a key or a click of a mouse. As far as personal use of The Internet’s communicative inhibitors go, I have used its services to communicate with others through mainly VOIP and email. However, on occasion I have also used tools such as Skype and Facebook. I have found that by not adhering to the advances in communicating via The Internet, I am restricting my ability to maintain a healthy relationship amongst the individuals whom I consider to be important in my life. This reliance upon The Internet’s service is both concerning and fascinating at the same time. However, no matter what one may feel about the role that The Internet plays in our everyday lives, it is no secret that its advances are imminent. Of course one cannot be certain as to how far The Internet’s evolution will go.
