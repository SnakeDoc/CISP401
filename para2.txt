Search engine: I like to use safari, and Google chrome. I use safari because I think it is a little more secure comparing others due to my protection with apple. But for storing my data I prefer store them in Google doc instead of usb or other devices. I find Google doc more reliable. I used to simply type the keywords on browser that I wanted to find, but now after taking this course and the lab that we take I learned how to classified the searching tools. I like the advance search in Google. Iâ€™m going to practice it more often.
