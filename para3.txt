Communication: I use Internet for communication in many ways. As I mention earlier, I use it to call my family and friends. For example, I use oovoo.com or skype.com for video calling. Also I use magic jack for my phone calling. The good point about magic jack is that for instance if I go out of country, I can still answer my income calls for free because magic jack works over internet. It never charges me. Also I can call any land phone in US from outside of the country. On the other hand I use Google tools such as Google voice to forward and manage all the greeting income and outcome calling.
